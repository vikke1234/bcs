\chapter{Cryptography\label{crypto}}
Cryptography has always been important, it's been used since ancient times to
secure communication. In today's world where we have a lot of information that
needs to get from place to place it is especially important to make sure that
it isn't tampered with. We have lots of ways to make sure that it gets
transported safely, in this chapter we're going to give an overview about
different kinds of cryptography and how it can be used in junction with FPGAs.
FPGAs can make for example hash functions among other things faster. With
quantum computers coming soon the cryptographic functions we have now, for
example RSA can be broken in polynomial time.

\section{Public key cryptography}
Public key cryptography is works by having having two sets of public- and
private keys. Before the 1976 public key cryptography was quite difficult there
were no good way to exchange keys. This changed when the Diffie and Hellman key
exchange was invented \citep{FranciscoRodriguez-Henriquez10}. This allowed for
keys to be exchanged quickly and securely.
