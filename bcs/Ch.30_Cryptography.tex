% What is symmetric and assymetric cryptography
\chapter{Cryptography\label{crypto}}
Cryptography has always been important, it is been used since ancient times to
secure communication. In today's world where we have a lot of information that % TODO rewrite: it is especially important in today's world
needs to get from place to place it is especially important to make sure that
it is not tampered with. We have lots of ways to make sure that it gets
transported safely, in this chapter we are going to give an overview about
different kinds of cryptography and how it can be used in junction with FPGAs.
FPGAs can make for example hash functions among other things faster. With
quantum computers coming soon the cryptographic functions we have now, for
example RSA can be broken in polynomial time.

\section{Public key cryptography}
\textit{Public key cryptography} is works by having having two sets of public- and
private keys. Before the 1976 public key cryptography was quite difficult there
were no good way to exchange keys. Everything changed when the Diffie and
Hellman key exchange was invented \citep[Ch. 2]{FranciscoRodriguez-Henriquez10}. This
allowed for keys to be exchanged quickly and securely.

\subsection{Asymmetric cryptography}
\textit{Asymmetric encryption} is a type of encryption that utilizes these two
keys, it encrypts using the private key and decrypts with the private one.
A modern implementation of this is for example AES.


\subsection{Symmetric cryptography}
\textit{Symmetric cryptography} is a little different than asymmetric
cryptography, it only uses one key for both encryption and decryption. Today
there are two different types of symmetric cryptography, stream and block
ciphers. Stream ciphers work
