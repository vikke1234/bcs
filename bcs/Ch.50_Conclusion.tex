\chapter{Conclusion\label{conclusion}}
This thesis covers the basics of FPGAs and presents an example of a post
quantum secure cryptosystem. We can see that FPGAs are very useful as they
provide the means to quickly compute matrix multiplication due to being very
good at parallelization. We also present efficient hardware modules that
are roughly $20\% - 78\%$ faster than the previous implementations
\citep{FPGA_Post_Quantum_Primitives}.
