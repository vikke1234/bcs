\chapter{FPGA usages in cryptography\label{FPGA_crypto}}
In the earlier chapters we gave an overview on how FPGAs and public key
cryptography works. In this chapter we're going to cover how they can be used
in junction with each other. We're going to give an overview about how hash
functions and block ciphers can be implemented on FPGAs.
