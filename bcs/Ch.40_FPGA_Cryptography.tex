\chapter{FPGA usages in cryptography\label{FPGA_crypto}}
Due to the high demand on fast cryptographic methods, optimized implementations
became of huge interest. Hence the motivation behind developing faster FPGA
implementation of cryptographic schemes. In this chapter we are giving an
overview of optimized FPGA implementations for R-LWE.
