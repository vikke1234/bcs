\chapter{FPGA usages in cryptography\label{FPGA_crypto}}
Due to the high demand on fast cryptographic methods, optimized implementations
became of huge interest. Hence the motivation behind developing faster FPGA
implementation of cryptographic schemes. In this chapter we are giving an
overview of optimized FPGA implementations for R-LWE.

    \label{fig:high_level_pkc_impl}

\end{figure}

The implementation as seen in Figure \ref{fig:high_level_pkc_impl} consist of
three different modules: key generation, encryption and decryption. These
modules consist of a few basic operations, polynomial multiplication,
polynomial addition, subtraction and scalar division to the nearest integer.
The most expensive complexity-wise is the modulo operation which can take a few
hundred LUTs \citep{FPGA_Post_Quantum_Primitives}. Which is why these designs
try to minimize the amount of modulo operations with operations such as
conditional assignment.

\begin{itemize}

    \item
        Polynomial addition and subtraction is the most common operation in the
        R-LWE cryptosystem. It uses a hardware circuit to do the polynomial
        addition/subtraction and conditional assignment to avoid using the
        modulo operation.

    \item
        Scalar multiplication uses multiplexers to once again save LUTs as
        $m$ is an $n$-bit vector, when computing $t\cdot m$ we choose
        essentially $t$ or $0$.

    \item
        Let $d = (c_0 - s \cdot c_1)$ and $t = \frac{t}{2}$, we can implement
        scalar division to the nearest integer by computing
        \[|d - t| < \frac{t}{2} \quad ? \quad 1 \quad : \quad 0\]

        As $|d - t|$ measures the distance between $d$ and $t$; if the
        distance between the two is larger than $t / 2$ it means that $d$ and
        $t$ are far from each other, this means that $\frac{d}{t}$ the nearest
        integer will be $0$. On the other hand if $|d - t|$ is smaller than $t
        / 2$ it means that the nearest integer will be $1$.

    \item
        Polynomial multiplication is by far the most complex of these modules.
        Multiplication can change the degree of the polynomial, which increases
        the complexity of the component. It uses \textit{Number Theoretic
        Transform} (NTT) which is a generalized version of FFT over the ring
        $R_q = R / \langle q \rangle = \bZ_q [x] / (x^n + 1)$ to compute the
        polynomials. The NTT equation is the following: let $\omega$ be the
        $n$-th root of unity in the field of the polynomial ring.

        \[ X_i = \sum^{n-1}_{k=0} x_k \cdot \omega^{i\cdot k} \]

        $\omega$ has to satisfy the following conditions, firstly
        $\omega^n = 1 \mod q$. Secondly the period of
        $\omega^i \ \forall i \in \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, n - 1\}$ has to be exactly
        $n$.

\end{itemize}
